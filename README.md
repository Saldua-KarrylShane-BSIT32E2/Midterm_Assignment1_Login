Understanding the architecture of an ASP.NET MVC application is essential for developing web applications effectively. Let's break down the architecture described in the provided code into simpler terms:

Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture:

Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application. In the provided code, the User entity and related logic are part of the Model.
View: Represents the user interface (UI) of the application. Views are responsible for rendering data to the user. In the code, the .cshtml files under the Views folder represent the views for different actions.
Controller: Handles user input and orchestrates the interaction between the Model and the View. Controllers contain action methods that respond to user requests. In the code, the AccountController and HomeController are examples of controllers.
Onion Architecture:

Onion Architecture is a software architectural pattern that emphasizes separation of concerns and maintaining a clear dependency hierarchy.
In the provided code, the application is structured with layers such as Domain, Application Service, and Infrastructure.
Domain Layer: Contains the core entities and business logic of the application. It's the heart of the application where the actual business rules are implemented. In the code, the User entity and related logic reside in the Domain layer.
Application Service Layer: Contains application-specific logic, such as user registration and login functionalities. This layer acts as an intermediary between the Presentation layer (Controllers) and the Domain layer. In the code, the UserService class handles user registration and login.
Infrastructure Layer: Provides infrastructure-related functionalities, such as password hashing and validation. In the code, the BcryptHelper class in the Infrastructure layer handles password hashing and validation.
In-Memory Storage Mechanism:

For demonstration purposes, an in-memory storage mechanism (e.g., Dictionary) is used to store hashed credentials. This means that user data is stored temporarily in memory during the application's runtime and is not persisted in a database.
In a real-world scenario, you would typically replace the in-memory storage with a database for persistent data storage.
Connecting Pages:

The application consists of multiple pages, such as the registration form, login form, and dashboard.
Navigation between pages is facilitated through hyperlinks and form submissions. For example, after successful registration, users are redirected to the login page, and after successful login, they are redirected to the dashboard.
